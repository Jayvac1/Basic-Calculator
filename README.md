# Basic-Calculator

This is just some random calculator written in C++ that I whipped up when I was bored in my homeroom. It took me about 10 minutes to make.
I guess you could read the code to learn the very bare basics of C++. Not useful for anything else.
All you could learn from this is how to use "cout" "cin" and "switch".
